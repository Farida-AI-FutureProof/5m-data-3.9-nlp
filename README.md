## Lesson ObjectivesS

Ath the end of the lesson, learners shall be able to:

* Apply text preprocessing and **normalization techniques** to transform raw unstructured text into a clean format suitable for analysis.

* Construct **statistical language models** to estimate the probability of word sequences in a given corpus.

* Implement the **Vector Space Model (VSM)** using TF-IDF weighting and cosine similarity to mathematically represent text documents and measure their semantic similarity.
